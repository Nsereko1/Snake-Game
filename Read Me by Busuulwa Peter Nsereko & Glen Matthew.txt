Snake Game
A classic Snake Game developed using Python and Pygame, designed with a modular, class-based architecture in Agile.
The game features smooth movement, sound effects, animated food, multiple game states and levels, and increasing difficulty.
This project was developed as part of coursework at Victoria University (2025) by:
1. Busuulwa Peter Nsereko

2. Glenn Mathew

1: Game Overview
The player controls a snake that moves around a grid-based environment, collecting food to grow longer and increase their score.
The game ends if the snake collides with the wall or with itself.
The game includes:
   * Start menu
   * Gameplay with HUD (score, level, time)
   * Game-over screen with restart option
   * Sound and visual effects
   * Game-loading state
  
2: Game Architecture
The game follows a modular design to improve readability, maintainability, and scalability.

3: Development Methodology
The project was developed using the Agile Methodology, enabling iterative development and continuous improvement.
Agile practices applied include:
      * Incremental feature development
      * Continuous testing and debugging
      * Frequent refactoring for better modularity
      * Flexibility in adding new features such as levels, sound effects, and UI states

	Move Right
	Enter
	Start / Restart

	5: Scoring System
         * Each food item increases the snake’s length
         * Score increases based on game speed (FPS)
         * Higher levels introduce faster movement and increased challenge

6: Game Rules
            * The snake cannot reverse direction instantly
            * The Snakes only moves in forward direction, head to tail
            * The game ends if:

               1. The snake hits the wall
               2. The snake collides with itself

                  * The player progresses by surviving longer and collecting more food
  


7: Visual & Audio Features
                     * Smooth snake movement animation
                     * Animated “wiggle” food effect
                     * Background GUI for gameplay
                     * Sound effects for:

                        1. Eating food
                        2. Game over
                        3. Menu interactions
  
Testing & Validation
The game was tested for:
                           * Accurate snake movement
                           * Correct collision detection
                           * Stable scoring and level progression
                           * Visual Size on Screen Fits all Desktop Devices
                           * Menu navigation and state transitions

All major bugs were resolved during testing.
